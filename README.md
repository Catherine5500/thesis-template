latex thesis template for temple university

## history
This is built off of the work of Xiali (Sharon) Hei, shared (here)[https://sites.google.com/a/temple.edu/xiali_hei/home/temple-dissertation-thesis-latex-template].
The original posting data of February 2014 means this version was behind with the current (requirements)[http://www.temple.edu/grad/documents/Dissertation-and-Thesis-Handbook.pdf] listed by the Graduate College.
As of February 2017 this repository is attempting to bring the package up to date for all members of Temple University wishing to use LaTex to draft Masters or PhD Proposals or Defenses.
